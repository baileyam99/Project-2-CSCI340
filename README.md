<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a an assignment for CSCI 340: Operating Systems with Dr. Ralph Crosby. We had about 3 weeks to complete the project with a partner.

Run this command in terminal: > `go run project2.go {num consumers}`

* As directed, type either a string or a file name.

* Program was supposed to loop, however, this caused issues with processes. Program will execute once, then terminate.

* Run program again from terminal to test another string/file.

* Three .txt files included for testing.
